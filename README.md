# Linux Security Report 
A simple bash script that runs different commands to conduct a basic security assessment of a Linux endpoint. 

I initially wrote this script several years ago before I had ever heard about LinEnum. I decided to keep and upload it since I wrote it with a defensive mindset and it has all the information I am generally looking for.
